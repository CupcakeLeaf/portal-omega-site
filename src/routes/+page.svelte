	Hello! We are a team of 13 people called Cool People Games, developing a portal mod called Portal
	Omega. This website clearly isnt finished yet, but you can still check out our discord server,
	apply as a test subject, and watch the mod trailer!
</p>
<h6>
	the trailer is of a very early build so it doesn't look the best and our mod is way farther in
	development and more polished currently
